## Fake News Detector
This project was made in order to access the validity of websites for information and to evaluate sources for misleading information.
Two different models were created to determine the probability of a website being fake:
1. Logistic Regression (logistic_regression.ipynb)
2. Recurrent Neural Network (recurrent_neural_network.py)
